# ISE 182 BGU Project - Group #8

"todo" comments in the code means uncompleted feature we need to implement.

What is left to do? (update this on the go)

- handling error/exceptions

- working with handlers of objects instead of objects themselves

- sorting of messages

- checking 150 characters of message before sending

- implementation of the logger (https://moodle2.bgu.ac.il/moodle/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=253650)


***Please write in whatsapp before you start coding something so we will know***

# Basic guideline for the code: 

RunChat-->GUI-->Chat_EventHandler-->Chatroom-->anything else depends on the user's choice
