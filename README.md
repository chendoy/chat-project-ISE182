"todo" comments in the code means uncompleted feature we need to implement.

What is left to do?

- handling error/exceptions

- working with handlers of objects instead of objects themselves

- sorting of messages

- cheking 150 characters of message before sending

- implementation of the logger (log4net or something similar. Guy posted in the forum he might be giving instructions to this)
